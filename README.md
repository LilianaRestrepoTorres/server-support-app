# AI Support Tickets System :robot: 

This is an AI-powered Support Tickets system built in Python with Flask. This application accepts a report of an issue in natural language format, analyzes it using an GPT3.5-turbo AI model, and creates a ticket. You can then **retrieve all tickets**, check the **status of a specific ticket** or **update the status of a ticket**.

## Key Features
- **AI Content Generation:** The system accepts natural language reports of problems with bots or orders. Then, process the input to extract **problem location**, **problem type** (software, hardware, or field) and a **summary** of the issue.
- **Support during AI Model Downtime:** We've added error handling to ensure continuous operation even when the GPT-3.5-turbo is offline or at its request limit. We support this feature by creating tickets for prompt assistance.
- **Data Persistence:** The application application stores data locally in a JSON file. It's a starting point for future improvements.


Enjoy using the AI Support Ticket System! :rocket:
